# activitypub-trust-and-safety

Repository for a report on improving the trust, safety, and integrity of ActivityPub and related specifications by the W3C 
[Social Web Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/swicg/).

Latest editor's drafts:
- [Initial Report](https://swicg.github.io/activitypub-trust-and-safety/initial-report/)
- [Overview](https://swicg.github.io/activitypub-trust-and-safety/) (not started)

It is used:

* As an issue tracker for Trust and Safety related ideas, requests, and issues.
* As a repository of Reports, Notes, and other task force deliverables.

**Note:** we cannot directly change or improve various software that implements ActivityPub within the scope of this Taskforce, for that, please file issues with the respective project's issue trackers, potentially cross referencing issues here.

## Taskforce Leadership

This taskforce is led by:

- Emelia Smith ([@thisismissem](https://github.com/thisismissem) / [@thisismissem@hachyderm.io](https://hachyderm.io/@thisismissem))
- Darius Kazemi ([@dariusk](https://github.com/dariusk) / [@darius@friend.camp](https://friend.camp/@darius))

Emelia and Darius are responsible for coordinating and running the taskforce meetings, their primary role is to facilitate consensus-building among taskforce members.

## Scope of work

The initial scope of work for this task force is split into three workstreams, as follows:

- Initial Report ([#32](https://github.com/swicg/activitypub-trust-and-safety/issues/32))
  - Overview of current state of trust and safety on the Fediverse
  - Documenting how ActivityPub functionality is currently used
  - Best Practices & Recommendations
- Improving Moderation Activities (Flag and Blocks) ([#38](https://github.com/swicg/activitypub-trust-and-safety/issues/38))
  - Addressing for where to send these activities
  - Additional properties to improve federation of moderation activities (e.g., category and evidence on Flag Activities)
  - Inter-server communication on moderation activities
- Content warnings, labels, and annotations ([#41](https://github.com/swicg/activitypub-trust-and-safety/issues/41))

This taskforce is intended to be ongoing, as the work of trust and safety is an ongoing matter. Additional work items may come in from the SocialCG or the taskforce, and be added to future workstreams.
