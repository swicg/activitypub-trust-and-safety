# activitypub-trust-and-safety

Repository for a Social Web Community Group report on improving the trust, safety, and integrity of ActivityPub and related specifications.

Latest editor's draft: https://swicg.github.io/activitypub-trust-and-safety/ (pending)

It is used:

* As an issue tracker for Trust and Safety related ideas, requests, and issues.
* As a repository of Reports, Notes, and other task force deliverables.

## Scope of work

The scope of this task force is still to be defined, however, we should likely emphasize first improving existing issues before creating new features. e.g., prefer issues like "recommend the usage of the replies collection" over something like "implement federation of domain blocks", where the latter is something that isn't well defined at all yet, where as the former is.

The full scope of work will be defined by the task force members during the early meetings.

## Other Discussion Forums

In addition to this repository, conversation also occurs at:

* W3C `public-swicg` [SocialWeb CG mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-swicg/) (for general discussion)
* [Fediverse Enhancement Protocols](https://codeberg.org/fediverse/fep) repository (for related specification under
  incubation)
