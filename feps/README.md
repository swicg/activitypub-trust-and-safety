## About these FEPs

We'll initially be authoring some Fediverse Enhancement Proposals (FEPs) within the taskforce repository, discussing them and reviewing them, before ultimately opening pull requests against the [FEP repository](https://codeberg.org/fediverse/fep/src/branch/main/) for them.

FEPs proposed here should not be relied upon by developers, as they are a work-in-progress.

To author a FEP in the context of this taskforce, please create a branch and then use the template in `feps/_template.md` to setup the FEP.
