## Summary

Labels are used to tag content and actors to allow people on the fediverse to better decide what they do or don't want to see. This FEP introduces a new `Label` object type, as well as a collection for labels.

This FEP does not cover application of labels by third-parties, which is to be covered by a future FEP.
