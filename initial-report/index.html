    <p>
      This is the initial report from the Social CG <a
        href="https://github.com/swicg/activitypub-trust-and-safety">Taskforce on Trust and Safety for ActivityPub</a>,
      ActivityStreams 2.0
      and the Fediverse. We've structured this document to outline why we need to think about trust and safety, the
      current trust and safety features in ActivityPub, the current areas of work we're undertaking to improve trust and
      safety in ActivityPub, and advice for people building ActivityPub enabled software.
