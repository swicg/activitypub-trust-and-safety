# 2024-11-26: ActivityPub Trust and Safety Task Force Meeting

During this meeting, no meeting notes were captured due to not having access to hedgedoc for collaborative note taking, we've since rectified this for future meetings.

We spent the meeting working on the premise that the taskforce will likely have multiple independent workstreams and documenting those, resulting in a pull request to the [README](https://github.com/swicg/activitypub-trust-and-safety/pull/39) to document these workstreams.
